Spinner: a spin lattice simulation library

This library allows the creation of D-dimensional lattices or more general structures of spins from n-vector models (such as Ising, XY, Heisenberg, etc), sometimes also called O(n) models, and their simulation using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods.

WARNING: This library is in early stage of development: it might produce incorrect results. It comes with absolutely no warranty, and you should use it at your own risk. Contributions are welcome.

WARNING: So far only the single spin-flip metropolis dynamics has been implemented, and the only interaction available is ferromagnetic.

NOTE: Support for the Potts models and more interactions (long range, spin-glass, etc) is planned.

Read the documentation for basic usage examples.
