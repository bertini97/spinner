## What has been implemented:

*

> **WARNING**: So far only the single spin-flip Metropolis and the cluster flip Wolff dynamics has been implemented, and the only interaction available is ferromagnetic.

> **NOTE**: Support for the Potts models and more interactions (long range, spin-glass, etc) is planned.
